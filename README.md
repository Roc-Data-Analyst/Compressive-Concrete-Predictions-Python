# Compressive-Concrete-Strength-Predictions-in-Python
This is my first attempt at a Python project. I decided to utilize regression analysis for my strength prediction and SciKit-Learn module, train_test_split for the Machine Learning Model to split the training and testing parts. I fit the information to the model that had the closest accuracy (RandomForestRegressor) of predictors to come up with a  machine learning model prediction for the compressive strength of concrete.
